#  JavaScript Learning Journey 

Welcome to my JavaScript Repository! ðŸŽ‰ This is where I document my learning process as I explore the world of JavaScript. I'm just starting out, and this repository will serve as a collection of notes, practice exercises, and small projects as I build my skills step by step. 


##  Highlights of My Learning
1. Basic Concepts  
   - Understanding variables (`var`, `let`, `const`)  
   - Using loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)  
   - Creating functions (both regular and arrow functions)  
   - Manipulating the DOM for dynamic web pages 
2. **DOM Manipulation**  
   - Selecting elements  
   - Modifying elements dynamically  
   - Event handling  

3. **ES6+ Features**  
   - Template literals  
   - Destructuring  
   - Spread and rest operators 

## ðŸ”§Tech Stack
- **Language**: JavaScript  
- **Tools**: Node.js, VS Code  
- **Environment**: Browser, Node.js
